# moten.fm
moten.fm is a concrete poetry mix comprised of tracks played in "free jazz: the realistic spot" a class taught by [fred moten](https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/performance-studies/fred-moten)  at new york university. both the mix and website were created by [neta bomani](https://netabomani.com) for "material of language" a class taught by [allison parrish](https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/itp/853082171) at the same university.
